Insight to international exchange https://web.archive.org/web/20180629070817/https://www.bitxoxo.exchange/

They had planned Debit cards, Crypto e-univeristy, P2P marketplace, expansion to Singapor, UAE and australia, incubator program since they had kind of scammy (not offically confirmed) history i don't think that happend

Threat turing investigation: 
(Note the international exchange was not available again to this day 07/01/2020) 

Interesting insight - capture of the international exchange : https://web.archive.org/web/20180629070817/https://www.bitxoxo.exchange/

they had an australian registration at some point after checking the ACN in open corporates I found that they were inactive

https://opencorporates.com/companies/au/625042631

My interpretation in combination with the absence of the international exchange page and wtih several bitcointalk/reddits asking if they are a scam (followed by replies that look as if they were bought/ fake praising their services) is that they don't operate that service anymore. In either case Australia was just a branch not the parent according to opencorporate."
